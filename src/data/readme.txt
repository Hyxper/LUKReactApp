In most practical applications, directly reading page content from a JSON file is not the preferred approach.
Instead, itâ€™s common to use a library like Axios (or a similar HTTP client) to fetch data dynamically from an API. 
This approach ensures a more decoupled architecture and allows the page to be updated independently of its underlying data source.

To maintain type safety and facilitate development in TypeScript, I would define corresponding 'Model' types or interfaces to represent the structure of the data being fetched.

Additionally, I would leverage React hooks, such as useEffect and useState, to manage and populate the page content dynamically.
This approach promotes scalability and maintainability, reducing the risk of tightly coupling the data source to the page components.

For a real-world project, especially in a B2C solution, dynamically fetching data and adhering to best practices ensures that the application is both modular and easier to maintain over time.
